                        Achilles, known as Ἀχιλλεύς (Achilleús) in Ancient Greek, was one of the most celebrated heroes
                        of Greek mythology and is central to Homer’s Iliad. Renowned as the greatest of the Greek
                        warriors during the Trojan War, he was the son of the sea nymph Thetis and Peleus, the king of
                        Phthia and a notable Argonaut. Achilles grew up in Phthia, where he was educated by the wise
                        centaur Chiron and spent his early years with his close friend and companion, Patroclus.
                        <br><br>
                        In the Iliad, Achilles leads the Myrmidons, a fierce and loyal tribe, and is depicted as a
                        figure of immense strength and prowess. His most famous act during the Trojan War was the
                        killing of Hector, the Trojan prince and the champion of Troy, outside the city gates. This
                        battle was a defining moment in the epic, showcasing Achilles’s skill in combat and his deep
                        capacity for both rage and grief. However, the Iliad does not cover Achilles’s death, and other
                        ancient sources tell us that he met his end near the conclusion of the Trojan War when Paris,
                        the prince of Troy, shot him with an arrow, often said to have been guided by the god Apollo to
                        strike Achilles in his only vulnerable spot—his heel.
                        <br><br>
                        The myth of Achilles’ vulnerability stems from a story that his mother, Thetis, dipped him in
                        the river Styx as an infant, intending to make him invulnerable. However, she held him by his
                        heel, which did not touch the water and remained susceptible to injury. This led to the later
                        legend that Achilles was impervious everywhere except for his heel, which ultimately became his
                        downfall. This story gave rise to the phrase Achilles' heel, referring to a critical weakness in
                        an otherwise strong individual or system. The tendon that connects the calf muscles to the heel
                        is known as the Achilles tendon, named after him and linked to the same myth.
                        <br><br>
                        Achilles’s legacy endures as a symbol of unmatched heroism and tragic vulnerability, resonating
                        in literature, art, and language as the embodiment of both the greatest strength and the
                        greatest weakness.
