                        In Greek mythology, Andromeda (Ancient Greek: Ἀνδρομέδα, romanized: Androméda or Ἀνδρομέδη, Andromédē) is the daughter of Cepheus, the king of Aethiopia, and his wife, Cassiopeia. Her story begins with her mother’s prideful boast that she or her daughter was more beautiful than the Nereids, sea nymphs who were beloved by the god Poseidon. In response to this hubris, Poseidon unleashed the sea monster Cetus to wreak havoc on the coast of Aethiopia as divine retribution. To appease Poseidon and stop the monster’s rampage, Cassiopeia and Cepheus were compelled to sacrifice their daughter by chaining her to a rock by the sea.

                        Andromeda's fate took a dramatic turn when Perseus, the hero returning from his quest to slay Medusa, encountered her. Perseus, armed with the magical items gifted to him by the gods, including the head of Medusa, saw Andromeda’s peril and was struck by her beauty. He vowed to save her and, after defeating Cetus by using Medusa's head to turn the monster to stone, rescued Andromeda and married her. The couple returned to Greece, where Andromeda became Perseus’s queen, and their union was said to have led to the birth of future generations, connecting her story with that of heroic lineages.
                        <br><br>
                        Andromeda’s myth has inspired art and literature for centuries, from classical antiquity to modern times, with the tale being one of the earliest examples of the “princess and dragon” motif. This iconic rescue narrative has been depicted in various forms, including plays, poetry, novels, operas, paintings, and music. The story was especially popular in the Renaissance period, drawing from sources such as Ovid’s Metamorphoses. The constellation Andromeda, located in the northern sky, is named after her and serves as a testament to her lasting cultural significance.
                        <br><br>
                        The Andromeda myth has also been blended with other tales over time, adding complexity and further influencing the "hero and dragon" theme. For instance, elements of the Pegasus legend and the tale of Bellerophon’s winged horse are often intertwined with the Andromeda tradition. The epic poem Orlando Furioso by Ludovico Ariosto introduced additional layers, further shaping the myth's evolution. Despite the widespread popularity of Andromeda’s story, interpretations have not been without criticism. In particular, the portrayal of Andromeda as a white woman has been challenged, especially given Ovid’s description, which hints at a darker complexion. Additionally, some scholars have pointed out that the myth's repeated depiction by male artists reinforced a narrative of male dominance and female subjugation, with Andromeda portrayed as passive and in need of rescue by a male hero, emphasizing gender power dynamics in art and storytelling.
