                    <h1 class="h11">ARES</h1>
                    <p class="pp">Ares is the Greek god of war and courage, known for embodying the brutal and violent aspects of combat. As one of the Twelve Olympian gods and the son of Zeus and Hera, Ares is often depicted as the fierce and aggressive deity who represents the chaos and bloodshed of battle. While he exemplifies the physical valor needed to succeed in warfare, he contrasts sharply with his sister Athena, who embodies strategic warfare, wisdom, and military leadership. This distinction highlights Ares' role as a god who inspires raw, unrestrained conflict and a dangerous, militaristic energy.
                        <br><br>
                        The origins of Ares' name can be traced back to Mycenaean times, but his reputation for savagery and his warrior-like nature may have roots in Thracian religious practices. Some ancient Greek cities and cities in Asia Minor held festivals to bind and control Ares, seeing him as their protector. In certain areas of Asia Minor, he was even revered as an oracular god, and the Scythians reportedly practiced ritual sacrifices, including killing one in every hundred prisoners of war, as offerings to their version of Ares. The belief that the Spartans may have sacrificed humans to honor Ares is more likely linked to myth and reputation than to documented historical practices.
                        <br><br>
                        In Greek mythology, Ares is featured less prominently than other gods, and when he does appear, he is often portrayed as a figure of ridicule and defeat. His most notable role in mythology occurs during the Trojan War, where Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty, persuades Ares to support the Trojans. Despite his involvement, the Trojans ultimately lose, with Athena aiding the Greeks and leading them to victory. Ares' reputation for infamy is underscored by the story in which Hephaestus, the god of craftsmanship, traps Ares and Aphrodite in a net after discovering their affair. This exposes their scandalous behavior to the laughter and mockery of the other gods, further highlighting Ares' less-than-glorious place in the divine hierarchy.
                        <br><br>
                        The Roman counterpart to Ares is Mars, who held a more esteemed role in Roman religion as the guardian deity of the Roman people and the state. While Ares was viewed with ambivalence in Greece, Mars was revered as a protector and an ancestor of Rome’s founding heroes, giving him a more elevated status. Over time, as Latin literature adopted and reinterpreted Greek myths, the figure of Mars merged with Ares, creating a figure that, in Western art and literature, became almost indistinguishable from his Greek counterpart. Mars’ greater importance in Roman culture stands in stark contrast to Ares’ often negative portrayal in Greek myth.
