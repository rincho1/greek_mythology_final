                    <p class="pp">Artemis, in ancient Greek religion and mythology, is the goddess of the hunt, wilderness, wild animals, nature, vegetation, childbirth, and chastity. She was also associated with the care of children and later identified with Selene, the Moon goddess. Known for roaming the forests and mountains accompanied by her band of nymphs, Artemis embodies independence and strength. Her Roman counterpart is Diana, reflecting similar attributes in Roman culture.
                        <br><br>
                        Artemis is the daughter of Zeus and Leto and the twin sister of Apollo. According to Greek mythology, their birth was the result of Zeus's extramarital affair, which angered his wife Hera. Hera decreed that Leto could not give birth on solid land, leading Leto to find refuge on the floating island of Delos, where she gave birth to Artemis and then Apollo. In some accounts, Artemis was born first and aided in delivering her brother. Known for her kourotrophic nature, she was a protector of young children, particularly girls, and worshipped as a goddess of childbirth, alongside Eileithyia and Hera.
                        <br><br>
                        Artemis was also revered as a healer and a deity who could bring both health and illness, particularly to women and children. As one of the three major virgin goddesses—alongside Athena and Hestia—Artemis was fiercely devoted to her chastity, remaining unmarried and beyond Aphrodite's influence. This commitment to purity was central to her identity and many myths.
                        <br><br>
                        In myth, Artemis is depicted as a huntress with a bow, arrow, and quiver, often accompanied by wild animals. Her myths include tales of retribution, such as transforming Actaeon into a stag and having him torn apart by his own hunting dogs after he spied on her bathing. In the story of Callisto, Artemis expelled the girl from her group for breaking her vow of virginity. In the Trojan War legend, Artemis demanded the sacrifice of Iphigenia after Agamemnon killed her sacred deer, but she saved Iphigenia at the last moment, substituting a deer in her place. Artemis' worship was widespread, with temples and shrines across Greece, including the famous Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Her sacred symbols included the bow, arrows, hunting knives, deer, and cypress tree.
