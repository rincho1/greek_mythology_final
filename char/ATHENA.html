                    <h1 class="h11">ATHENA</h1>
                    <p class="pp">Athena, or Athene, is an ancient Greek goddess associated with wisdom, warfare, and craftsmanship, and was later syncretized with the Roman goddess Minerva. She is most prominently recognized as the patron goddess of Athens, where the Parthenon, a grand temple on the Acropolis, stands in her honor. Athena’s symbols include owls, representing wisdom, olive trees for peace, snakes, and the Gorgoneion, a protective emblem. She is often depicted in art wearing a helmet and holding a spear, signifying her warrior nature.
                        <br><br>
                        In Greek mythology, Athena's birth is one of the most iconic stories: she sprang fully formed and armored from the forehead of Zeus after he swallowed her mother, Metis, to prevent a prophecy that their child would be more powerful than him. This miraculous birth emphasized Athena’s association with wisdom and purity. She was also known as Athena Parthenos ("Athena the Virgin"), highlighting her independence and strength.
                        <br><br>
                        Athena was not only a goddess of war but also a protector and benefactor of cities. She competed with Poseidon for the patronage of Athens and won by creating the first olive tree, a symbol of prosperity. Athena’s influence extended to many heroes, including Perseus, Heracles, and Odysseus, whom she assisted on their quests. In the Iliad, she supported the Achaeans in the Trojan War, and in the Odyssey, she guided Odysseus through his long journey home.
                        <br><br>
                        Athena’s myths include acts of protection and punishment. In Ovid’s writings, she transformed Arachne into a spider after their weaving contest and punished Medusa by turning her into a Gorgon after Poseon raped her in Athena’s temple. Over time, Athena became more than a deity of Greek mythology; she emerged as a symbol of wisdom, the arts, and democracy, embodying ideals celebrated in Western culture.
