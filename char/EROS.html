                    <h1 class="h11">EROS</h1>
                    <p class="pp">Eros is the Greek god of love and desire, often associated with the powers of attraction and sexual desire. His Roman counterpart is Cupid, whose name means "desire." In early accounts, Eros is depicted as a primordial deity, representing an essential force of creation and love. Later myths, however, portray him as the child of Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty, and Ares, the god of war. Eros, along with his siblings, formed a group known as the Erotes, a collective of winged deities embodying various aspects of love.
                        <br><br>
                        Eros is typically depicted as a young, handsome figure, though sometimes he appears as a playful and mischievous boy, often in the company of his mother, Aphrodite. He is always winged and carries his distinctive bow and arrows, which he uses to cause love and desire in both mortals and gods. While Eros frequently acts as a catalyst in love stories, facilitating romantic encounters under the direction of Aphrodite, he has little mythology of his own. An exception to this is the story of Eros and Psyche, a tale in which Eros falls in love with the mortal princess Psyche and embarks on a journey that tests their love and devotion. This myth explores themes of trust, love, and redemption and has been influential in Western art and literature.
                        <br><br>
                        In art tradition, Eros and his Roman counterpart Cupid are also known as Putto, a cherubic figure typically depicted as a chubby, winged child. The imagery of Putti, plural of Putto, became widespread in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, where they were used in religious art as symbols of divine love and innocence. This iconography evolved into the more familiar cherub, which later became an enduring symbol of Valentine’s Day, representing love and affection.
                        <br><br>
                        The legacy of Eros/Cupid as a figure of love and attraction has endured through the ages. His depiction in Christian art as a cherub, coupled with the themes of love and romance associated with him, has made him a central figure in the celebration of Valentine’s Day, symbolizing romantic love and the playful, sometimes mischievous, nature of love itself.
