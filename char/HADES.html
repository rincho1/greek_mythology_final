                    <p class="pp">Hades, in ancient Greek religion and mythology, is the god of the dead and ruler of the underworld, a domain that became synonymous with his name. He was the eldest son of Cronus and Rhea, but also the last to be regurgitated by his father after being swallowed at birth. Hades, along with his brothers Zeus and Poseidon, overthrew the Titans in a great battle, dividing the cosmos among themselves. Hades was assigned the underworld, Zeus took dominion over the sky, and Poseidon ruled the sea, while the earth remained a shared realm. In artistic depictions, Hades is often shown with a bident (a two-pronged staff) and wearing his distinctive helm of invisibility. By his side is Cerberus, the formidable three-headed guardian of the underworld.
                        <br><br>
                        Though Hades was a significant figure in Greek mythology, the Romans later associated him with their own deities, such as the Etruscan god Aita, and the Roman gods Dis Pater and Orcus. These deities were eventually merged under the name Pluto, a Latinized version of the Greek name Plouton (Πλούτων), which means "the rich one." This title reflects Hades' role as the god who presides over the wealth of the earth, including precious metals and resources hidden beneath the ground. This dual aspect of Hades as both the god of death and the guardian of earthly wealth highlights the complex nature of his character: feared yet respected as an essential ruler who ensures the balance between life and death.
