                    <h1 class="h11">HELIOS</h1>
                    <p class="pp">In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Helios was the god who personified the Sun. His name, pronounced Hēlios (Ἥλιος) in Greek and sometimes Latinized as Helius, signified his connection to the radiant power of the sun. Helios was often depicted with a crown of light, driving a brilliant, horse-drawn chariot across the sky, illuminating the world with his golden rays. He was known by epithets such as Hyperion ("the one above") and Phaethon ("the shining"), emphasizing his supreme position in the heavens. Though Helios was considered a relatively minor deity in Classical Greece, his worship gained more prominence in late antiquity as he became associated with major solar deities of the Roman period, particularly Apollo and Sol. The Roman Emperor Julian, for instance, made Helios the central figure in his attempt to revive traditional Roman religious practices in the 4th century AD.
                        <br><br>
                        Helios’ family connections were also significant in mythology. He was the son of the Titans Hyperion and Theia and the brother of Selene, the goddess of the Moon, and Eos, the goddess of the Dawn. This trio represented the celestial bodies that traversed the sky, linking the daily cycles of day and night in Greek cosmology. The story of his son, Phaethon, is one of Helios' most well-known myths. Phaethon attempted to drive his father's sun chariot but lost control, leading to chaos and his eventual demise. Helios’ grief and the consequences of Phaethon’s recklessness underscore themes of power, responsibility, and divine retribution in Greek mythology.
                        <br><br>
                        In the Odyssey, Helios plays a crucial role in the tale of Odysseus. When Odysseus' men, despite being warned, killed and ate Helios' sacred cattle on the island of Thrinacia, Helios was enraged. He called upon Zeus to punish the transgressors. Zeus, agreeing to Helios’ demand, struck their ship with a thunderbolt, resulting in the death of all the crew except for Odysseus, who was spared because he had not participated in the sacrilege. This story highlights Helios' role as an all-seeing witness, reinforcing his reputation as the sun god who observed both gods and mortals alike.

                        Helios’ position as an all-seeing deity made him an important figure in ancient oaths and magic, as he was believed to witness the truth and ensure that promises were kept. In art, he is typically portrayed as a youthful, beardless figure wearing a chiton and holding a whip while driving a quadriga, his four-horse chariot. He was often depicted alongside other celestial deities like Selene, Eos, or the stars, emphasizing his connection to the broader cosmos. Helios was worshipped in several places in ancient Greece, with major cult centers in Rhodes—where he was considered the patron god—and also in Corinth and the greater Corinthia region. The Colossus of Rhodes, a monumental statue of Helios, was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It stood at the entrance of the harbor until it was destroyed by an earthquake in 226 BC and was never rebuilt.
