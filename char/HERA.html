                    <p class="pp">Hera, known as the goddess of marriage, women, and family in ancient Greek religion, is also revered as the protector of women during childbirth. As queen of the twelve Olympian gods and ruler of Mount Olympus, she is depicted as the sister and wife of Zeus and is the daughter of the Titans Cronus and Rhea. Hera is famously portrayed in mythology as embodying a powerful yet vengeful nature, particularly in her relentless pursuit of those who provoked her wrath, especially Zeus's many lovers and illegitimate children.
                        <br><br>
                        In artistic depictions, Hera is often shown as a regal and matronly figure, seated or standing in an upright posture. She is usually crowned with a polos or diadem and sometimes depicted with a veil, emphasizing her status as a married woman. Hera’s role extends to presiding over and sanctifying marriages, as well as safeguarding women during childbirth. This protective aspect solidifies her position as the goddess of lawful marriage and family stability.
                        <br><br>
                        Her sacred animals include the cow, cuckoo, and peacock, each symbolizing different aspects of her divine presence. The peacock, in particular, is associated with her beauty and power, while the cow symbolizes fertility and maternal qualities. Hera is also sometimes portrayed holding a pomegranate, an ancient symbol of immortality and rebirth, reinforcing her connection to life and continuity.
                        <br><br>
                        In Roman mythology, Hera’s counterpart is Juno, who shares many of Hera’s attributes and is similarly regarded as the queen of the gods and the goddess of marriage. Both deities are central to their respective mythologies, embodying the values of marital fidelity, family loyalty, and the protection of women.
