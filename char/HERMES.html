                    <h1 class="h11">HERMES</h1>
                    <p class="pp">Hermes, an Olympian deity in ancient Greek religion and mythology, is renowned as the herald of the gods and a protector of various groups, including human heralds, travelers, thieves, merchants, and orators. He is known for his ability to traverse freely between the mortal and divine worlds, aided by his iconic winged sandals. In addition to his role as a messenger, Hermes served as a psychopomp, guiding souls to the afterlife.
                        <br><br>
                        In myth, Hermes is often depicted as the son of Zeus and Maia, one of the Pleiades. He is known as "the divine trickster," a title that underscores his cunning and playful nature. The Homeric Hymn to Hermes provides one of the most famous accounts of his cleverness, detailing his mischievous exploits from infancy.
                        <br><br>
                        Hermes's attributes and symbols are varied and significant. His most recognized symbol is the caduceus, a winged staff intertwined with two snakes. Other symbols associated with him include the herma (a stone pillar with a carved head), the rooster, the tortoise, a satchel or pouch, and his winged sandals (talaria) or sometimes a simple petasos hat. Other symbols include the palm tree, goat, the number four, certain types of fish, and incense, emphasizing his multifaceted nature and associations.
                        <br><br>
                        In Roman mythology, many of Hermes’s characteristics were transferred to Mercury, a god whose name is derived from the Latin merx, meaning "merchandise," linking him to commerce and trade—domains that Hermes was also connected to.
