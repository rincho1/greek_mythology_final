                    <p class="pp">
                        In Greek mythology, Iphigenia (Ancient Greek: Ἰφιγένεια, romanized: Iphigeneia) is a tragic figure best known as the daughter of Agamemnon, the king of Mycenae, and his wife Clytemnestra, and for her role in the story of the Trojan War. Iphigenia’s story is filled with themes of sacrifice, loyalty, and divine intervention, and it reflects the complexities of fate, duty, and the human condition in Greek myth.
                        <br><br>
                        Iphigenia's tale begins with the Greek fleet preparing to set sail for Troy under the leadership of Agamemnon, who had pledged to lead an expedition to retrieve Helen of Sparta. However, the fleet was trapped at the port of Aulis by unfavorable winds, which the seer Calchas revealed were the result of Artemis's wrath. According to Calchas, the goddess was angered because Agamemnon had killed a sacred deer in her sanctuary and boasted that he was a better hunter than she. To appease Artemis and allow the fleet to depart, Agamemnon was instructed to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to her.
                        <br><br>
                        The decision to sacrifice Iphigenia was devastating for Agamemnon, but he ultimately agreed to it to fulfill his obligations to the Greek army. He tricked Clytemnestra and Iphigenia into believing that the sacrifice was necessary to marry Iphigenia to Achilles, the hero of the Greek forces, and secure favorable winds. When Iphigenia arrived at Aulis, however, she realized the true purpose of her summoning and was devastated by the betrayal. Different versions of the story describe different endings: in one version, she is sacrificed at the altar, while in another, Artemis intervenes at the last moment, whisking Iphigenia away and replacing her with a deer, sparing her life and taking her to Tauris (modern-day Crimea), where she becomes a priestess of Artemis.
                        <br><br>
                        In the version where she is saved, Iphigenia later plays a role in the myth of Orestes, her brother, and Electra, her sister. She is often portrayed as a symbol of sacrifice and the personal cost of war and duty. Her story also explores the themes of divine retribution and the fragility of human plans in the face of the gods’ will. The tragic nature of Iphigenia's tale has been a powerful subject for dramatization and reinterpretation in literature, including plays by Euripides (such as Iphigenia in Aulis and Iphigenia in Tauris), where her character embodies innocence and the cruelty of fate. Through her story, Iphigenia represents the sacrifices made in the name of duty, the love of family, and the merciless demands of the gods.
