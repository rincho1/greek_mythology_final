                        Midas (/ˈmaɪdəs/; Ancient Greek: Μίδας) was an ancient king of Phrygia, a kingdom in Anatolia, who is remembered for the numerous myths and legends associated with his name. His lineage traced back to his father, Gordias, who was credited with founding the Phrygian capital city of Gordium and tying the famous Gordian Knot—a task that later became a symbol of solving complex problems. His mother, Cybele, the Great Mother goddess, was an important figure in Phrygian religion, adding divine associations to Midas's legendary status. The most renowned tale of King Midas is the story of the golden touch, which endowed him with the ability to turn everything he touched into pure gold. This remarkable gift, however, quickly turned into a curse, as Midas was unable to eat or drink, and even his own daughter was transformed into gold upon his embrace. This tale encapsulates themes of greed, hubris, and the perils of unchecked desire.

                        Despite the fame of the Midas myth, historical and literary sources present different facets of his legacy. The Midas of mythological renown is believed to have lived during the 2nd millennium BC, predating the Trojan War. However, Homer, the celebrated Greek poet, does not mention Midas or his father Gordias, opting instead to include other Phrygian rulers, Mygdon and Otreus, in his epic tales. The absence of Midas in Homeric works suggests that while his story was widely recognized, it may not have been part of the core myths that were later immortalized in Greek epic literature. Nevertheless, the legends surrounding him highlight his importance as a historical and cultural figure, with his name possibly inspiring the founding of Midaeum, a city named in his honor.

                        Some scholars and historical accounts, such as those by Pausanias, suggest that this legendary Midas was also involved in the founding of Ancyra, which is modern-day Ankara. This association points to the influential nature of Midas’s reign and his possible role in establishing political and cultural institutions in Phrygia. His mythological and historical presence may have been a blend of truth and embellishment, which made Midas a figure of fascination for centuries. Over time, this Midas became synonymous with wealth and the consequences of excessive desire for material gain, serving as a cautionary tale that resonated across generations.

                        There were other rulers bearing the name Midas, indicating that it may have been a title or a common name within the Phrygian royal house. One such king ruled in the late 8th century BC and is often identified with Mita, mentioned in Assyrian texts as the king of the Mushki, a people believed to have occupied parts of Anatolia. This Midas/Mita led a conflict with the Assyrian Empire and its Anatolian allies, showcasing a more historical and warlike aspect of the Midas legacy. Another king of the same name is cited by Herodotus, the Greek historian, as part of the Phrygian royal lineage in the 6th century BC. These varying references highlight the enduring legacy and significance of the Midas name in Phrygian history, bridging myth and historical records to create an enduring figure in both ancient storytelling and historical analysis.
