                    <p class="pp">
                        Paris, known in Ancient Greek as Πάρις and also by the name Alexander (Ἀλέξανδρος), is a prominent figure in the mythological narrative of the Trojan War. He is featured in many Greek legends and works of ancient literature, most notably in Homer’s Iliad. As a prince of Troy, Paris was the son of King Priam and Queen Hecuba, and he was the younger brother of Hector, the famed Trojan warrior and defender of his city.
                        <br><br>
                        Paris’s role in the Trojan War is pivotal and begins with his fateful decision to abduct Helen, the beautiful queen of Sparta. This act of elopement was not only an act of passion but also the spark that ignited the legendary conflict between the Greeks and the Trojans. The war, which would rage for ten years, led to countless tales of heroism, betrayal, and divine intervention. Paris’s actions brought devastation upon Troy, yet he also played a significant part in the war’s epic scope.
                        <br><br>
                        One of Paris's most memorable contributions to the war is his duel with the greatest Greek hero, Achilles. According to myth, Paris fatally wounded Achilles with an arrow, which was guided by the god Apollo to strike the vulnerable heel of the warrior—an act that ultimately led to Achilles’s demise. This moment cemented Paris’s legacy as both a catalyst of the war and a warrior whose actions significantly impacted its outcome, despite his reputation as less heroic than his brother Hector.
                        <br><br>
                        Paris’s story reflects themes of love, fate, and the complexities of human desire and consequence. His decisions and the subsequent war embody the intertwining of personal choices and larger destinies, shaping him into a figure of both admiration and infamy in the annals of Greek mythology.
