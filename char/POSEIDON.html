                    <h1 class="h11">POSEIDON</h1>
                    <p class="pp">Poseidon is one of the most prominent figures in ancient Greek religion and mythology, serving as one of the Twelve Olympian gods. He presides over the sea, storms, earthquakes, and horses, and was revered as the protector of seafarers and guardian of many Greek cities and colonies. In pre-Olympian Bronze Age Greece, Poseidon was a principal deity in places such as Pylos and Thebes, where he was known by the cult title "earth shaker." In myths from isolated Arcadia, Poseidon was connected to Demeter and Persephone and was worshipped as both a horse deity and a god of the waters. This dual association continued throughout Greek culture, where Poseidon was seen as the tamer or father of horses, with the Greeks believing that he created springs with a strike of his trident. The Greek term for horses and springs shares linguistic roots, reinforcing this link. His Roman counterpart is Neptune.
                        <br><br>
                        According to the works of Homer and Hesiod, Poseidon became lord of the sea after the overthrow of his father, Cronus. When the world was divided among Cronus' three sons, Zeus received the sky, Hades the underworld, and Poseidon the sea, with Earth and Mount Olympus shared among them. Poseidon's role in the Iliad includes supporting the Greeks during the Trojan War, while in the Odyssey, Poseidon's anger is unleashed when Odysseus blinds his son, the Cyclops Polyphemus. This act of defiance leads to Poseidon punishing Odysseus with fierce storms, which result in the loss of his ship and crew and delay his return to Ithaca for ten years. Poseidon also features in a Homeric hymn, and in Platoâ€™s Timaeus and Critias, he is depicted as the ruler of the legendary island of Atlantis.
                        <br><br>
                        Poseidon's reputation extends to his fierce competitions with other deities for the patronage of cities. A well-known myth is his contest with Athena for the title of patron deity of Athens. Though Poseidon struck the ground with his trident, producing a saltwater spring or, in some versions, a horse, Athena won favor by offering the olive tree, symbolizing peace and prosperity. In retaliation for losing the patronage, Poseidon sent a devastating flood to the Attic plain to punish the Athenians. Similar stories of Poseidon's wrath occur in other regions where he competed for city patronage, underscoring his nature as a vengeful and formidable god. Despite his sometimes malevolent qualities, Poseidon had to be honored and respected, even if he was not the city's patron deity.
                        <br><br>
                        Scholars have debated Poseidon's origins, suggesting that he might have been a Pelasgian or a Minyan god. However, it is also possible that, like Zeus, Poseidon was an ancient deity worshiped by all Greeks from the beginning. This idea points to Poseidon's long-standing significance in Greek mythology as a powerful force of nature, both revered and feared for his control over the sea and the potential for catastrophic storms and earthquakes.
