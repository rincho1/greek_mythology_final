                    <p class="pp">Prometheus, one of the Titans and a god of fire, is best known for defying the Olympian gods by stealing fire from them and giving it to humanity. In doing so, he brought to mankind not just the gift of fire, but also the tools of civilization—technology, knowledge, and culture. Prometheus is often regarded as a champion of humanity, credited with shaping the course of human progress.
                        <br><br>
                        In some versions of the myth, Prometheus is also said to have created humanity from clay. Known for his intelligence and foresight, he is frequently portrayed as the author of the human arts and sciences. In certain traditions, he is even considered the father of Deucalion, the hero who survived the great flood in Greek mythology.
                        <br><br>
                        However, Prometheus' act of stealing fire did not go unpunished. Zeus, the king of the Olympian gods, condemned him to eternal torment for his transgression. Bound to a rock, Prometheus was subjected to the relentless torment of an eagle—the emblem of Zeus—who would eat his liver each day. In Greek thought, the liver was believed to be the seat of human emotions. Each night, Prometheus' liver would regenerate, only to be devoured again the following day, creating an unending cycle of suffering.
                        <br><br>
                        Despite the severity of his punishment, Prometheus' fate was eventually altered. According to the myth, he was freed by the hero Heracles (Hercules), who defeated the eagle and released him from his chains. The location of Prometheus' punishment varies in different versions of the myth. Some sources place his torment at Mount Elbrus or Mount Kazbek, two volcanic peaks in the Caucasus Mountains, beyond which lay the lands of the barbarian tribes—symbolically representing the boundary between civilization and the unknown.</p>
