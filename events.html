      <h1>The History of Greek Mythology</h1>
      <p style="text-align: center;"> Greek Mythology has bequeathed upon us an invaluable heritage of stories with
        envying gods, strong heroes, epic adventures and stories of vengeance and love. The corpus of Greek Mythology is
        vast and it would require several volumes of books to cover most of the stories. However, as is natural, not all
        those stories are equally in love with us. And here are abridgments of 15 of the most famous tales from Greek
        Mythology.</p>

        <h1>Pandora's Box</h1>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">After Prometheus gave the fire to humans, Zeus decided to take vengeance. He
          ordered Hephaestus to create the first human woman out of soil and water. Each god gave the woman a gift:
          Athena gave her wisdom, Aphrodite beauty, Hermes cunning and so on. The name of the woman was Pandora (meaning
          “all gifts” in Greek). Zeus gave Pandora a jar, warning her not to open it under any circumstances and sent
          her to Prometheus’ brother, Epimetheus. Prometheus had warned his brother not to accept any gifts from Zeus.
          However, Epimetheus accepted Pandora who, although tried hard to resist the temptation, opened the jar and
          released all evils upon the world. Hatred, war, death, hunger, sickness and all the disasters were immediately
          released.</p>

        <h1>The Legendary Myth of Odysseus</h1>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">Odysseus (also known with his Latin name ‘Ulysses’) was a great hero of Homer’s
          epic poems Iliad and Odyssey. The Odyssey recounts his adventures since he left Troy, in his effort to return
          home. His wandering lasted for no less than ten years! His adventures were many: he fought against the
          Cicones, broke free from the Lotus-Eaters, escaped with cunning the Cyclop Polyphemus and son of Poseidon by
          blinding him, making the sea god his enemy. He then visited the island of Aelous, the Wind God, receiving a
          sack as a gift, which contained all the winds inside, to help him arrive home. As they were arriving in
          Ithaca, two of his men opened the sack out of curiosity while Odysseus was sleeping and their ship was once
          again away from Ithaca because of the storm that followed. He then survived the Laestrygonians, a tribe of
          man-eating giants and landed on the island of the sorceress Circe. With the help of Hermes, Odysseus left the
          island and journeyed to the Underworld, to get help from the blind prophet Tiresias who had died. He then
          passed through the Sirens and their seductive song by blocking the ears of his men with wax and ordering them
          to tie him up to the mast, so that he could not jump and join the Sirens. His next challenge was to cross the
          strait between Scylla, a six-headed monster, and Charybdis, a violent whirlpool, which he managed to do by
          sacrificing six of his men.</p>

        <h1>The Great Trojan War</h1>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">The events that occurred in the myth of the Apple of Discord would lead to the
          greatest war of Greek Mythology. The Trojan War is an epic poem, written by Homer. Having been promised by
          Aphrodite the love of the most beautiful woman, Paris abducted Helen, wife of Menelaus of Sparta. Refusing to
          return Helen, Menelaus’ brother, Agamemnon, gathered a great army of Greeks to sail to Troy. At Aulis, the
          army was gathered, with the greatest Greek heroes among them - Achilles, Patroclus, Odysseus, Nestor to name a
          few. However, there was no wind for the ships to sail and the warriors started to complain. The reason for
          this was the killing of Artemis’ sacred deer by Agamemnon. The Greek King was forced to sacrifice his
          daughter, Iphigenia, to appease Artemis and the winds came. For nine years the Greek army was trying to enter
          the walls of Troy without any luck. Finally, Odysseus had an idea to build a gigantic hollow wooden horse, in
          which a small group of warriors would conceal. The other Greeks appeared to sail for home, leaving behind the
          horse as a gift to the Trojans. Despite the warnings of Cassandra and others, the Trojans took the horse
          inside the walls and celebrated with a lot of wine and music. When everyone was asleep, the Greek warriors
          crept out of the horse and opened the gates. The Greek army entered without resistance and Troy fell. Achilles
          died during the battle, having been hit in the heel by an arrow. The gods also took part in the war. Hera,
          Poseidon and Athena aided the Greeks, while Ares and Aphrodite the Trojans.</p>

        <h1>The Apple of Discord</h1>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">The great Trojan War started with a few envious Gods and an apple... During the
          wedding of Thetis and Peleus, the goddess of discord, Eris, was not invited for apparent reasons. Eris felt
          offended and, arriving at the wedding, tossed in the middle of the feast of the gods a golden apple, saying
          “to the fairest”. The apple was claimed by Hera, Athena and Aphrodite, sparking a vanity-fueled dispute among
          the three. The goddesses asked Zeus who the apple belonged to (in other words, who is the fairest of them all)
          and Zeus said that Paris, a mortal man and the rightful Prince of Troy, should choose. Paris at the time was
          living as a shepherd on Mount Ida and was not aware of his royal descent. He had been abandoned as a baby,
          because of an oracle that said he would cause the destruction of his city. The three goddesses appeared before
          the shepherd Paris and asked him to choose who is the fairest of them all. Because Paris at first was unable
          to choose one, each of the goddesses offered him a gift: Hera offered him wealth and kingly power, Athena
          wisdom and glory among men, and Aphrodite offered him the love of the most beautiful woman in the world.
          Without hesitation, Paris gave the golden apple to Aphrodite. From that day on, Aphrodite was offering council
          to Paris. She was the one that informed him of his royal blood and led him back to Troy. The rest is history…

        <h1>King Midas and his Golden Touch</h1>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">In Greek Mythology, Midas was the king of Phrygia and ruled from his castle and
          its beautiful garden in which “roses grow of themselves, each bearing sixty blossoms and of surpassing
          fragrance”, according to Herodotus. One day, some of Midas’ people found a drunken old man near the garden and
          brought him before the king. Midas recognized the old man, who was god Dionysus’ closest reveler, the satyr
          Silenus. Instead of punishing him, Midas hosted the satyr for ten days, offering him food, drinks and
          entertaining him. When he returned him safely to Dionysus, the god felt gratitude and offered Midas to grant
          him any wish he had. Midas, motivated by his greed, asked that he should be able to turn into gold everything
          he touched. At first, Midas gained great wealth and power from his unique ability. But he later realized that
          it was more of a curse than a gift. Even the water and the food that he touched was turning into gold. He
          could not enjoy even the simplest joys in life anymore. Midas went back to Dionysus and begged him to take
          back his power.</p>

        <h1>The Myth of Andromeda and Perseus</h1>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">Long ago, the African Kingdom of Ethiopia was ruled by a king named Cepheus and
          his queen Cassiopeia. The royal couple had a daughter, Andromeda. One day, the queen boasted about her beauty
          before the mythical inhabitants of the sea - the Nereids. Nereids became very angry because they believed
          themselves the most beautiful creatures in the world. They complained to their father, the god of the seas,
          Poseidon, that he should punish her. The mighty lord of the seas sent a huge sea monster to ravage the coast
          of Ethiopia, including the vain queen. The desperate King asked for the guidance of Apollo in Delphi. The
          Oracle advised that no respite would be found until the king and the queen sacrificed their daughter to the
          monster. To appease Poseidon, Cepheus and Cassiopeia offered, reluctantly, their beloved daughter to be eaten
          by the monster. The beautiful Andromeda was chained on a seaside rock and awaited her fate. Meanwhile, the
          great hero Perseus was returning from having slain Medusa, riding the winged horse, Pegasus, high in the sky.
          Passing over Ethiopia, he saw Andromeda chained on the rock and immediately fell in love with her. As the
          monster was approaching to devour Andromeda, the brave Perseus started fighting it; their fight lasted for a
          long time. Finally, Perseus used the deadly look of Medusa's severed head, petrifying the huge monster which
          fell in the sea and became an island. Perseus freed Andromeda from her chains and took her back to the palace
          of Cepheus where they got married. They lived together happily, having seven sons and two daughters. After
          Andromeda’s death, goddess Athena placed her among the constellations in the northern sky, near Perseus and
          Cassiopeia.</p>

        <h1>Bellerophon and Pegasus</h1>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">Bellerophon was a great hero of Greek Mythology. He was a slayer of monsters and
          as famous as Perseus. His most famous feat was the killing of Chimera, a horrible monster with a goat's body,
          a serpent's tail and a lion's head that could breathe fire. The great hero was the son of the mortal woman
          Eurynome by either her husband and King of Corinth Glaucus or the god Poseidon. Bellerophon was accompanied in
          his adventures by the winged horse, Pegasus. The Myth has it that Pegasus was born from the blood of her
          beheaded mother Medusa, the gorgon who was tricked and killed by the hero Perseus. A more detailed version of
          the myth said that he was born when Medusa’s blood was mixed with the foam of the sea. The myth says that
          Pegasus was born as a winged horse because his father, Poseidon, had the shape of a horse when he seduced
          Medusa. When Pegasus was born, a huge thunder with lightning pierced the sky, and that’s how his connection to
          the forces of the skies was established. So, one day Bellerophon saw the wonderful animal drinking water and
          decided to tame it. This would not have been possible if Athena had not helped him, by giving him a golden
          bridle. After slaying Chimera, Bellerophon's fame grew and so did his arrogance. He believed that because of
          his great feat, he deserved to fly to the mountain of the gods, Olympus, and set course with Pegasus. Zeus was
          angered by his hubris and sent a gadfly to sting Pegasus, causing Bellerophon to fall off the flying horse.
          Pegasus continued to Olympus and became the loyal horse of Zeus. It is said that Athena spared the life of
          Bellerophon by softening the ground for his fall. However, the once-great hero spent his remaining life
          crippled and lonely, always searching for his beloved winged horse. </p>

        <h1>The Myth of Hermaphroditus</h1>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">Hermaphroditus was the son of Hermes and Aphrodite, and he was raised by nymphs
          in the caves of Mount Phrygia. On his face, one could see the grace and beauty of both of his parents, from
          whom he took his name. When he was fifteen years old, he left the mountain where he grew up to wander into
          Asia Minor and meet new people. In the woods of Caria, he stopped to rest and drink water from a spring called
          Salmacis. The homonymous nymph, Salmacis, was captivated by the beauty of the young man and tried to seduce
          him, but was rejected. When Hermaphroditus felt he was alone, he jumped into the water naked to swim. Salmacis
          appeared behind a tree and jumped in as well, wrapping her body around that of the young man, forcibly kissing
          and touching him. While Hermaphroditus was trying to break free from her, the nymph called out to the gods to
          let them be united forever. The gods decided to grant her wish and blended their two bodies into one, creating
          a creature of both sexes. Hermaphroditus prayed to his parents, Hermes and Aphrodite, that anyone else who
          bathed in that spring would share his fate. And the gods granted his wish.</p>

        <h1>The Myth of Narcissus and Echo </h1>
        <p style="text-align:justify;"> Echo was a wood Nymph, cursed by Hera to not be able to speak properly, but
          rather repeat the last words addressed to her. One day, she was wandering around the mountains, until she saw
          a handsome young man that no one could resist his charm, Narcissus. The Nymph fell in love with the youth, but
          could not speak to him because of Hera’s curse. So, she was following him from the shadows, silently and in
          love, waiting patiently for the proper moment. At some point, Narcissus felt her presence and asked “Is
          anybody here?”, to which Echo replied “here”. A confusing and repetitive conversation followed until Narcissus
          called her to come out and make love with him. But, as soon as Echo stepped out, Narcissus told her that he’d
          rather die than give himself to a wood nymph. Echo, heartbroken, took refuge in a cave and lost her appetite
          for food or water. After a while, poor Echo started growing skinny from starvation until her body disappeared,
          living only dust and her voice. Nemesis, the goddess of revenge against those who show hubris, decided to
          punish Narcissus for the treatment of poor Echo. The goddess made Narcissus fall in love with his own
          reflection that he saw in a pond near Echo’s cave. Narcissus could not leave his own reflection out of love
          and starved to death, like Echo. But, before he dies, Narcissus cried out to his reflection “Farewell, dear
          boy. Beloved in vain.” Echo’s voice repeated his last words from the cave as Narcissus drew his last breath.
          To this day, Echo still repeats the last words or phrases in caves or labyrinths.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify;"> In Greek Mythology Gods were powerful and humans should be obedient. But was
          that always the case? In ancient times there was a beautiful lady called Arachne (meaning “spider” in Greek).
          She knew the art of loom very well and she weaved beautifully. She boasted that she could weave better than
          Athena, who was the patroness of the weaving art. She even dared to ask the goddess to a contest. Athena
          accepted and they began to weave. Athena weaved a representation of her fight with Poseidon over the naming of
          Athena. Arachne, on the other hand, weaved the naughty adventures of Zeus and the other gods of Olympus.
          Athena, angered by the hubris Arachne dared to show, transformed her into a spider and cursed her to be
          hanging from her web for the remainder of her life.</p>

        <h1>The Myth of Apollo and Daphne </h1>
        <p style="text-align:justify;"> Daphne was a Naiad Nymph in Greek Mythology, the daughter of a river god. She
          was famous for being incredibly beautiful and for catching the eye of god Apollo. However, Daphne was
          determined to remain unmarried and untouched by a man for the rest of her life. According to Greek Mythology,
          Apollo had been mocking the God of Love, Eros. In retaliation, Eros fired two arrows: a golden arrow that
          struck Apollo and made him madly in love with Daphne, and a lead arrow that made Daphne hate Apollo. Under the
          spell of the arrow, Apollo continued to chase Daphne, but she continued to reject him. Apollo told Daphne that
          he would love her forever. Daphne turned to the river god, Peneus, and pleaded to him to free her from Apollo.
          In response, Peneus used metamorphosis to turn Daphne into a laurel tree. Apollo used his powers of eternal
          youth and immortality to make Daphne’s laurel leaves evergreen. It is believed that Daphne had to sacrifice
          her body and turn into a tree, as this was the only way she could avoid Apollo’s sexual advances. After Daphne
          had been transformed into a laurel, Apollo made the plant sacred and vowed to always wear it as clothing.
          Thus, in a way, Daphne stayed with Apollo forever…</p>

        <h1>The 12 Labors of Hercules</h1>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">Hercules is the most famous hero of Greek Mythology and well-known for his twelve
          labors. He was a demigod, son of Zeus and Alcmene. Hera, the wife of Zeus, hated Hercules and wanted to kill
          him. Driven mad by the goddess, Hercules killed his own sons by his wife Megara. After realizing what he did,
          he traveled to Delphi and asked Apollo how he could atone for his actions. Pythia, the Oracle of Apollo, told
          him to go to Tiryns and serve his cousin, King Eurystheus, for twelve years. Eurystheus, loathing his cousin,
          set him to complete twelve impossible labors. He ordered him to: 1) slay the Nemean Lion, 2) slay the
          nine-headed Lernaean Hydra, 3) capture the Golden Hind of Artemis, 4) capture the Erymanthian Boar, 5) clean
          the Augean stables in a single day, 6) slay the Stymphalian Birds, 7) capture the Cretan Bull, 8) steal the
          Mares of Diomedes, 9) obtain the girdle of Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons, 10) obtain the cattle of the
          monster Geryon, 11) steal the golden apples of the Hesperides, and 12) capture and bring back Cerberus, the
          three-headed dog of Hades. Hercules managed to complete all twelve labors and free himself from the service of
          Eurystheus, having atoned for the killing of his sons. Many more adventures followed until he found a tragic
          death from his wife, Megara.</p>

        <h1>The Love Story of Eros and Psyche</h1>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">In Greek Mythology, love has the highest praise. Psyche (meaning “soul” in
          Greek), was an impressive mortal girl, surpassing in beauty even the goddess of love, Aphrodite. Her beauty
          was so well-known that men from all over the land would visit her to admire her beauty. This made Aphrodite
          extremely jealous and decided to punish the girl. She ordered his son, Eros, who could make someone fall in
          love by hitting them with his arrows, to make Psyche fall in love with the vilest and despicable creature who
          walked on Earth. However, when Eros gazed upon Psyche he fell in love with her himself. He could not carry out
          his mother’s order and instead, he remained silent. The years went by and, despite her beauty, Psyche could
          not marry. All men admired her godly beauty but then would go on and marry another. Her parents decided to go
          to Delphi and ask for guidance from Apollo. The Oracle said that Psyche had to dress in black, climb a high
          mountain alone and stay there. Then, a winged serpent would come for her and take her as his wife. Psyche and
          her parents had no choice but to follow the god’s words. As she was waiting alone on the mountain, shaking and
          crying, the fresh wind of Zephyrus raised her and traveled her through the sky to the gates of a magnificent
          castle. There, a sweet voice greeted her and made her feel like home.</p>

        <h1>Perseus and the Gorgon Medusa</h1>
        <p style="text-align:justify;"> Another famous tale from Greek Mythology is the killing of the terrifying Gorgon
          Medusa from the great hero Perseus. Perseus was a demigod, son of the Olympian god Zeus and the mortal woman
          Danae. Perseus sought to kill Medusa, the only mortal of the three monstrous sisters. Instead of hair, Medusa
          had living venomous snakes on her head and anyone that would look at her eyes would immediately turn into
          stone. With the help and the wisdom of goddess Athena, Perseus approached the monster by looking through the
          reflection of a shield and cut off her head. Tip! For the "Percy Jackson" fans, Perseus was the inspiration of
          Rick Riordan (the author of the series) for Percy's name. If you are visiting Greece, do not miss the
          opportunity to participate in a Hero's Quest Inspired by Percy Jackson or customize your very own Percy
          Jackson-inspired tour, and follow in the footsteps of your beloved heroes.

        <h1>The Myth of King Aegeus </h1>
        <p style="text-align:justify;"> The legend has it that before Theseus left for the palace of King Minos in Crete
          to kill the Minotaur, Aegeus, his father and King of Athens, asked him to change the sails of his ship from
          black to white on his return home so that he knew that he survived. Aegeus waited patiently in Sounio to see
          his son’s ship return and the color of its sails. Theseus, although he killed the Minotaur and got out of the
          labyrinth safely, he forgot to change his sails to white. Seeing the ship with the black sails, Aegeus thought
          that his beloved son was killed. Sadness and grief filled his heart and mind, and without waiting to get the
          news from the men on the boats, fell from the rocks of Sounio into the sea below... Since then, the sea is
          called Aegean in his memory. And his son, Theseus, became the King of Athens.</p>

        Thor, the mighty god of thunder, might not always be the sharpest tool in the shed, but when it comes to
        smashing things with his hammer, Mjolnir, he's practically unstoppable. Just don't ask him to do his own

        Kratos, the God of War, has a tendency to take things very seriously. Armed with a Spartan rage and a bad
