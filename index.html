            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p> Greek gods and mythology. Stories that instruct people about something significant and meaningful are
                called myths. They were frequently used to educate people about things like disease and death,
                earthquakes and floods,
                and other occurrences that they might not always comprehend. Although they differ slightly, legends and
                myths are similar.
                However, Greek mythology is not limited to the tales of gods and goddesses. Human heroes are equally
                important and include Heracles (also known as Hercules), the explorer who completed twelve impossible
                tasks for King Eurystheus (and was later worshipped as a god for his achievement); Pandora, the first
                woman whose curiosity brought evil to mankind; Pygmalion, the king who fell in love with an ivory
                statue; Arachne, the weaver who was turned into a spider for her conceit; the handsome Trojan prince
                Ganymede, who became the cupbearer for the gods; Midas, the king with the golden touch; Narcissus, the
                young man who fell in love with his own reflection; and Kratos, a god of strength and power. Manticores
                and unicorns, Gorgons, pygmies, minotaurs, satyrs, and dragons of all kinds, the winged horse Pegasus,
                the horse-man Centaur, the lion-woman Sphinx and the bird-woman Harpies, the one-eyed giant Cyclops, and
                automatons—metal creatures given life by Hephaestus—are also common monsters and "hybrids" (human-animal
                forms) in the stories. Many of these animals are now nearly as well-known as the heroes, goddesses, and
                gods that they are based on. For thousands of years, Greek mythology's characters, tales, themes, and
                morals have influenced literature and the arts. They can be found in works like Dante's Inferno,
                Renaissance artworks like Botticelli's Birth of Venus and Raphael's Triumph of Galatea, Romantic poetry
                and libretti, and the soundtracks of more current plays, films, and books. D'Aulaires' Book of Greek
                Myths, which was released in 1962 and is still in print today, contains a large portion of the
                mythology.
